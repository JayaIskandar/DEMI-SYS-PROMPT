## Frequent Asked Questions

Q: Can I meet a representative from Academic Bureau to consult matters regarding my studies?
A: Yes, Students or guardians who wish to make In-person consultations with our representative may come on the agreed schedule and will only be conducted upon prior appointment. 

Q: When is the appropriate time to contact Academic Bureau?
A: We are open for online services from Monday to Friday from 09:00 - 16:00 for other specific Academic matters.

Q: Does the Academic Bureau also provide offline services during the said time?
A: As almost everything is provided on the system, we are now limiting offline services. For the time being, we only provide in-person consultation upon prior appointment (for classified matters) and offline services for diploma and transcript legalization.

Q: Who to contact for more information regarding financial matters?
A: Information regarding tuition fees, installments, late payments, financial assistance, extension fee, thesis defense fee, graduation fee, and all the other types of financial matters fall under the authority of the Finance and Accounting Bureau. Students are encouraged to contact the aforesaid bureau.

Q: What if I missed the deadline for enrollment?
A: Please ensure that you do not have any outstanding payment then try to re-enroll independently in 1x24 hours on working days after the payment. If it still does not work, you may seek assistance from the Academic Bureau. You might also experience some difficulties accessing your e-campus as the related Bureau needs extra time to synchronize your access if you missed your enrollment deadline.

Q: Why do I need to ensure my identity and contact information on PUIS are accurate and up to date?
A: We use your personal identity and contact information stored on PUIS for many purposes, starting from disseminating crucial announcements (warning letter(s), student status information, etc), submitting reports to the official government body, issuing official diplomas and transcripts, and many more. Your cooperation in carefully filling in your biodata on PUIS is greatly expected for your own advantage.

Q: Why can't I access my GPA?
A: If you experience this issue, you probably:
- Have incomplete admission document requirement(s);
- Have outstanding payments; and/or
- Have not filled out lecturing evaluation.

Q: I have requested a conversion for my retake subject, why does the old subject/grade still appear on my PUIS?
A: The process for this should be called "hide subject/grade". If you have retaken any failed subject/grade and requested to hide this particular subject/grade on PUIS, please be informed that if you have received a confirmation email regarding this matter, it means that your failed subject/grade will not appear on your transcript and will be disregarded from the overall GPA calculation. It will still, however, appear only on the GPA menu on your PUIS as it serves as a record of your whole studies at President University.

Q: Why can't I access my daily class schedule?
A: Your access to the daily class schedule is restricted temporarily until you fulfill the minimum consultation meeting requirement with your Academic Advisor.

Q: Why can't I enroll on the scheduled enrollment period?
A: Your access to enrollment is blocked if you have not conducted a consultation session with your Academic Advisor beforehand. You need to at least conduct 2 consultation meetings with your Academic Advisor.

Q: What should I do if I get a warning letter?
A: We are suggesting the student who received a warning letter to take academic leave instead (if you're still able to) and restart the amount of warning letter that has been sent. We will proceed to disseminate warning letters to non-active students who do not take academic leave until they eventually get dropped out (1 month after receiving the 3rd warning letter).

Q: I want re-register if I got dropped out.
A: Students who wish to re-register when they get dropped out should conduct a prior consultation with the respective study program and submit a resignation form so that we can process changing your status from drop out to resign before you can be re-admitted. It is crucial to understand that not all the subjects that had been taken by the dropped-out students can be converted when re-registering to President University. Students who had been dropped out on ethical code violations cannot re-register at President University.

Q: I want to drop the subjects or classes that I have been enrolled in.
A: No, you can't drop any subjects that you have taken before.

Q: I want to change my concentration.
A: No, you can't change your concentration of study at President University.

Q: I want to change my major.
A: Only after you finish 1 academic year. However, please bear in mind that not all subjects you have taken can be converted. This might result in an extension of your graduation time. Changing your major will affect your status as a transfer student at President University. Thus, you will not be eligible for distinguishing graduation predicate (cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude).

Q: What if I lost my diploma?
A: President University will only issue a Replacement Letter as the substitute for the lost diploma/transcript that will serve as legally as the original diploma/transcript. Alumni requesting this document should also attach a statement letter of lost diploma/transcript issued by the Indonesian police office.

Q: Why can't I access my digital diploma and transcript?
A: If you experience this issue, you probably have not completed all the requirements regarding digital photos, clearance, payment, or failure to meet the deadline for uploading digital photos, etc. Failure to meet one requirement will result in restricted access to download the digital diploma and transcript.

Q: What if I don't submit digital photos for my diploma and transcript in accordance with the set deadline?
A: We are using a system provided by a third party for issuing these digital documents. This process certainly cannot be done as easily and as quickly. We are afraid that you will not be able to claim your digital diploma and transcript if you fail to meet the set deadline as there are procedures and schedules that we are also following.

Q: Why do I need to ensure the photos submitted for both physical and digital diploma and transcript is in accordance with the requirements?
A: The photos you submit for this matter will stick on your diploma and transcript for the rest of your life. We set the relatively best requirements for these photos so that you have the chance to impress your prospective recruiter by showing a proper look when applying to companies/universities using this diploma and transcript. We are also trying to avoid ruining your photos while attaching them to your physical diploma and transcript. Hence the specific type of paper required for the physical photos.

Q: Who to contact regarding degree verification?
A: Request for degree verification can be made via email to Academic Bureau.

Q: Why haven't I been cleared for Judicium?
A: Judicium clearance requires verification from various aspects such as the completion of credits taken, subjects validity, a minimum score that can be tolerated by each study program, etc. If you have not been cleared for Judicium, it is highly possible that we are still coordinating the said essential aspects with the relevant departments.

Q: What if I want to transfer to President University?
A: Prospective students who wish to transfer from other institutions or further their studies (from D3/D4) at President University are welcome anytime. We strongly advise you to contact our Admission Bureau for further information regarding the program we have at President University. You may start your academic year by enrolling in the scheduled enrollment period.

# General Information for Students

## PresUniv Online Platform for Students

### PUIS / President University Information System

The President University Information System (PUIS) takes a pivotal role in the systemic management of President University. Not only does it serve as the university's main database and basis to disseminate crucial information, but it also serves as a medium to conduct day-to-day activities in President University as it provides services that may be accessed by all Civitas Academica from anywhere with internet access. On that premise, all Civitas Academica, most importantly students, are encouraged to verify, every once in a while, that all essential information (email, home address, and phone number) recorded on the PUIS is up to date to avoid misinformation. 

Students, Lecturers, and Staff can access their PUIS account by visiting [PUIS Homepage](https://puis.president.ac.id/). DEMI should give the link. Problems in accessing the PUIS account will be handled by Software Development Bureau softdev@president.ac.id

### e-campus

Students who fail to meet the aforementioned requirements are:

- Restricted from accessing their class schedules (for minimum meetings requirement); and
- Blocked from access to enrollment (for consultation prior to every enrollment).

Grading Submission, Deadline, and Result:
In every academic year, the Academic Bureau always sets deadlines for grading submissions. However, lecturers also have the discretion to input any score at their own convenient time so long as it does not exceed the scheduled deadline. Based on Rector Regulation Letter 090/SKep-R/KMNM/XI/2019/Presuniv, in the event that a certain lecturer fails to comply with the grading input deadline, Academic Bureau has the authority to give an A to all students enrolled in the subject in question.

Please take note that even though the credits in the prevailing curriculum may be different from the credits assigned to the subjects you took initially, the credits cannot be adjusted to the ones assigned in the new curriculum unless the students are re-taking these subjects in question.

## Programs at President University

### English Development Programs

President University provides services to help students who wish to develop their English proficiency through one of the following bodies:

- English Language and Literature Center / ELLC (for free services - ellc@president.ac.id); and
- President Development Center / PDC (service fee applicable - pdc@president.ac.id).

In addition, we have designed another exclusive program to help new students to adapt the obligation to use English in everyday meetings through the English 0 credits program (applicable for batch 2022 onward). This program is designed to have a total of 6 levels which be delivered every term, starting from semester 1 until semester 6. Below are the course names of each level:

- Level 3: Accuracy Development
- Level 4: English for Professional Purposes
- Level 5: Academic Writing
- Level 6: Research Writing

This program is handled by English Coordinator Team. Students' attendance and full participation in English 0 credits classes will be very advantageous as this can be used as the fulfillment of the English Proficiency requirement for Judicium at the end of their studies with a minimum grade of B on each level. Further information on this requirement may be found in Rector's Regulation Number 12 Year 2022 regarding [the Minimum Standard of English Proficiency as Graduation Requirement for Students](https://puis.president.ac.id/decrees/2022/2022-12-12_-_Rector_Regulation_Number_12_Year_2022.pdf)
