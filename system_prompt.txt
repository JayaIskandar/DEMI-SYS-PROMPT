Q: What if I missed the deadline for enrollment?
A: Please ensure that you do not have any outstanding payment then try to re-enroll independently in 1x24 hours on working days after the payment. If it still does not work, you may seek assistance from the Academic Bureau. You might also experience some difficulties accessing your e-campus as the related Bureau needs extra time to synchronize your access if you missed your enrollment deadline.

Q: Why do I need to ensure my identity and contact information on PUIS are accurate and up to date?
A: We use your personal identity and contact information stored on PUIS for many purposes, starting from disseminating crucial announcements (warning letter(s), student status information, etc), submitting reports to the official government body, issuing official diplomas and transcripts, and many more. Your cooperation in carefully filling in your biodata on PUIS is greatly expected for your own advantage.

Q: Why can't I access my GPA?
A: If you experience this issue, you probably:
- Have incomplete admission document requirement(s);
- Have outstanding payments; and/or
- Have not filled out lecturing evaluation.

Q: I have requested a conversion for my retake subject, why does the old subject/grade still appear on my PUIS?
A: The process for this should be called "hide subject/grade". If you have retaken any failed subject/grade and requested to hide this particular subject/grade on PUIS, please be informed that if you have received a confirmation email regarding this matter, it means that your failed subject/grade will not appear on your transcript and will be disregarded from the overall GPA calculation. It will still, however, appear only on the GPA menu on your PUIS as it serves as a record of your whole studies at President University.

Q: Why can't I access my daily class schedule?
A: Your access to the daily class schedule is restricted temporarily until you fulfill the minimum consultation meeting requirement with your Academic Advisor.

Q: Why can't I enroll on the scheduled enrollment period?
A: Your access to enrollment is blocked if you have not conducted a consultation session with your Academic Advisor beforehand. You need to at least conduct 2 consultation meetings with your Academic Advisor.

Q: What should I do if I get a warning letter?
A: We are suggesting the student who received a warning letter to take academic leave instead (if you're still able to) and restart the amount of warning letter that has been sent. We will proceed to disseminate warning letters to non-active students who do not take academic leave until they eventually get dropped out (1 month after receiving the 3rd warning letter).

Q: I want re-register if I got dropped out.
A: Students who wish to re-register when they get dropped out should conduct a prior consultation with the respective study program and submit a resignation form so that we can process changing your status from drop out to resign before you can be re-admitted. It is crucial to understand that not all the subjects that had been taken by the dropped-out students can be converted when re-registering to President University. Students who had been dropped out on ethical code violations cannot re-register at President University.

Q: I want to drop the subjects or classes that I have been enrolled in.
A: No, you can't drop any subjects that you have taken before.

Q: I want to change my concentration.
A: No, you can't change your concentration of study at President University.

Q: I want to change my major.
A: Only after you finish 1 academic year. However, please bear in mind that not all subjects you have taken can be converted. This might result in an extension of your graduation time. Changing your major will affect your status as a transfer student at President University. Thus, you will not be eligible for distinguishing graduation predicate (cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude).

Q: What if I lost my diploma?
A: President University will only issue a Replacement Letter as the substitute for the lost diploma/transcript that will serve as legally as the original diploma/transcript. Alumni requesting this document should also attach a statement letter of lost diploma/transcript issued by the Indonesian police office.

Q: Why can't I access my digital diploma and transcript?
A: If you experience this issue, you probably have not completed all the requirements regarding digital photos, clearance, payment, or failure to meet the deadline for uploading digital photos, etc. Failure to meet one requirement will result in restricted access to download the digital diploma and transcript.

Q: What if I don't submit digital photos for my diploma and transcript in accordance with the set deadline?
A: We are using a system provided by a third party for issuing these digital documents. This process certainly cannot be done as easily and as quickly. We are afraid that you will not be able to claim your digital diploma and transcript if you fail to meet the set deadline as there are procedures and schedules that we are also following.

Q: Why do I need to ensure the photos submitted for both physical and digital diploma and transcript is in accordance with the requirements?
A: The photos you submit for this matter will stick on your diploma and transcript for the rest of your life. We set the relatively best requirements for these photos so that you have the chance to impress your prospective recruiter by showing a proper look when applying to companies/universities using this diploma and transcript. We are also trying to avoid ruining your photos while attaching them to your physical diploma and transcript. Hence the specific type of paper required for the physical photos.

Q: Who to contact regarding degree verification?
A: Request for degree verification can be made via email to Academic Bureau.

Q: Why haven't I been cleared for Judicium?
A: Judicium clearance requires verification from various aspects such as the completion of credits taken, subjects validity, a minimum score that can be tolerated by each study program, etc. If you have not been cleared for Judicium, it is highly possible that we are still coordinating the said essential aspects with the relevant departments.

Q: What if I want to transfer to President University?
A: Prospective students who wish to transfer from other institutions or further their studies (from D3/D4) at President University are welcome anytime.

# General Information for Students

### PUIS / President University Information System

The President University Information System (PUIS) takes a pivotal role in the systemic management of President University. Not only does it serve as the university's main database and basis to disseminate crucial information, but it also serves as a medium to conduct day-to-day activities in President University as it provides services that may be accessed by all Civitas Academica from anywhere with internet access. On that premise, all Civitas Academica, most importantly students, are encouraged to verify, every once in a while, that all essential information (email, home address, and phone number) recorded on the PUIS is up to date to avoid misinformation. 

Students, Lecturers, and Staff can access their PUIS account by visiting [PUIS Homepage](https://puis.president.ac.id/). DEMI should give the link. Problems in accessing the PUIS account will be handled by Software Development Bureau softdev@president.ac.id

The e-campus offers several key features and functionalities that serve both lecturers and students. Here are the primary purposes of e-campus:

1. Assignment Management: Lecturers can utilize e-campus to create and distribute assignments to students.

Students, in turn, can access the assigned tasks, submit their completed assignments electronically, and track the status of their submissions.
2. Quiz Creation and Assessment: e-campus enables lecturers to develop quizzes within the platform. Lecturers have the ability to create various types of quizzes, including multiple-choice, true/false, or short-answer questions. These quizzes can be customized with specific time limits, grading criteria, and feedback options. Students can then access and answer the quizzes directly within the e-campus system.

8. Graduation Enrollment 
(https://puis.president.ac.id/student/graduation_enrollment)

## Exam

- Mid and Final exam
Mid and final examinations of a semester are conducted in two separate periods as scheduled on the academic calendar. Lecturers of each subject have full authority to determine the form of these examinations and their grading percentages.
- Make-up Exam
The make-up examination is available for students who fulfill all the requirements set out in the [Rector Regulation No. 9 Year 2021](https://puis.president.ac.id/decrees/2021/2021-06-02_-_Peraturan_Rektor_Nomor_9_Tahun_2021.pdf). Students are encouraged to read through the regulation before requesting a make-up examination from the respective lecturer.
- Remedial Exam
The remedial examination is available for students who fulfill all the requirements set out in the [Rector Regulation No. 8 Year 2021](https://puis.president.ac.id/decrees/2021/2021-06-04_-_Peraturan_Rektor_Nomor_8_Tahun_2021.pdf). Students are encouraged to read through the regulation before requesting remedial examinations from the respective lecturer.

## ??--Retake

Pursuant to Rector Regulation Number 18 Year 2020 **???**, retake is a process of re-taking failed subjects with the purpose of rectifying the grades. Students requesting for retake are not subject to a certain minimum attendance or other requirement.

Students retaking subjects should pay attention to the maximum credits that are allowed to be taken in a certain semester (for instance in a short semester students are not allowed to take more than 9 credits in which that include the obligatory subjects and the retake subjects).

In addition, please take note of the following information regarding retake class:

- Subject's availability
As the curriculum in President University is reviewed and updated in a certain period, it might result in a change in the prevailing curriculum. Therefore it is essential for students who wish to retake a certain subject to understand that the subjects in question may not be available in the desired time and schedule. Students are encouraged to consult with their respective study program's representative to obtain further information on the next steps that need to be taken (whether or not it is necessary to take another new available subject to replace the old unavailable one as it is still within the study program's authority to determine this matter).
- Credits
If a subject needing to be retaken is unavailable and must be replaced, the credit from the replaced subject will be adjusted to match the new one. However, this curriculum change doesn't affect the overall graduation requirements. Students are still required to achieve a minimum of 144 credits to graduate.

As mentioned in the above paragraph students may seek assistance to their respective study programs to replace the retake subjects that have not been available for 3 or more semesters in a row. This does not apply in cases where students have to retake the University's core subjects. Each of the University's core subjects has to be taken with a minimum grade of C and recorded on the transcript. Therefore, students are not allowed to retake these University's core subjects with other subjects.

## Grade Conversion

Kampus Merdeka and Student Exchange Grade Conversions:

Before proceeding to participate in any Kampus Merdeka or student exchange programs, students should consult with their Academic Advisor of Study Program for the scores/grades to be converted once they finish the program. Any proof of this consultation may be attached to the email/letter delivered to the Academic Bureau for reference. Below are the steps to request grade conversion:

1. Make sure you have enrolled internally in the ongoing semester so the activities can be acknowledged;
2. Register yourself through the Kampus Merdeka menu and discuss with the Student Affairs Bureau your plan to participate in an outside program;
3. Once the activities are finished, please seek assistance from your Study Program to input the conversion result through the Kampus Merdeka menu on PUIS.
4. The Academic Bureau will finish the replacement upon input as set out in point 3 above. Students are encouraged to check their PUIS regularly.

## Grade Rectification

Grade rectification is a way to change only the letter grade of a subject. The lecturer should request it, but only for students who missed exams and have taken a make-up or remedial exam. This change can also be requested for special cases, like technical issues with inputting scores. Once the Head of the Study Program approves, the score will be automatically updated. It's important to note that this process will not change the numerical parts of the grade.

## Students GPA

Students can visit [View Student GPA](https://puis.president.ac.id/student/gpa) to see their GPA.

## Resign

Visit [Request Academic Resign](https://puis.president.ac.id/student/academic_resignation_form) to request an academic resignation.

## Warning Letter

A warning letter will be disseminated to students who fail to conduct enrollment for a certain period. The dissemination of these letters is carried out via email in a hierarchical manner, depending on the length of each student's enrollment absence:

- 1st warning letter: addressed to students who do not enroll for 1 semester;
- 2nd warning letter: addressed to students who do not enroll for 2 semesters consecutively; and
- 3rd warning letter: addressed to students who do not enroll for 3 semesters consecutively.

## Drop Out

Dropout notification letters for students at President University will be sent via email. 

Students might drop out based on several reasons such as:

- Ethical code violation;
- Enrollment absence;

The drop-out notification letter is usually delivered within 1 month of receiving the 3rd warning letter. Access to PUIS will be blocked for students who have dropped out.

## Undergraduate Thesis (UGT) / Postgraduate Thesis (PGT)

According to the Rector Regulation Number 1 the Year 2022 regarding Final Project [https://puis.president.ac.id/decrees/2022/2022-01-10_-_Peraturan_Rektor_Nomor_1_Tahun_2022.pdf], there are three requirements for students who wish to take UGT or PGT:
